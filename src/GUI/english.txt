rules
The game is played by two to four players. Each player gets a piece to move on the board. In turns, the players cast the die and move forward as many tiles as the number the die shows. Some of the tiles are plots that can be bought if no player owns them already. The winner is the one with the most money, when one other player is declared bankrupt.
